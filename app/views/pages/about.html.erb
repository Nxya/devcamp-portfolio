        <p>My name is Alexander Brown, but most people know and call me by Alex. I'm in Lehi, Utah. I grew up with a love for technology, always amazed by it. For years I've dreamt of being a programmer, creating cool and exciting applications.</p>

        <p>In highschool I took two years of C++ and C# which showed me how much I actually loved working with code. Following my graduation I went and took the Bottega coding bootcamp, working with Ruby on Rails. It was here that I found a new love for coding. Working with Ruby has just been one of the most fluid and easy to work with languages that I've worked with. Granted, that's only three languages, but that's beside the point. I'm willing to work on just about anything, and I'm easy to work with since I believe cooperation leads to success.</p>
